## This is a project for interview task purposes

### Correct PIN
    
    123

### Input amount samples

     * Should dispense:
     * 197
     * Should not dispense:
     * 123, 126

### Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

I decide to use the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern because the object can decide who will be processing the dispensing and whether it will be necessary to send it to the next object in the chain. I applied the rule of the task by limiting the first two currencies.
I applied pin validation with "while" so you can try a lot of password without closing the console application.
    

### Thank you for the challenge and be free to give me a nice feedback!
